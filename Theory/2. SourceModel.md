# Aeroacoustic noise model

This file briefly describes the numerical modeling of the aeroacoustic noise coming from an airborne rotor used in the repository.

## 1. Physical origin of the noise

Looking at the bigger picture, noise is the result of differences in the pressure field. For a rotor, this difference is created by the relative movement between the air and the rotor blades.
For this specific case study, the noise emitted by the rotor is modeled as the sum of a tonal noise due to the blade passing frequency and a broadband noise due to turbulence-airfoil interaction.

## 2. Numerical model

### 2.1. Tonal noise model

A tonal noise is a signal generated by a discrete number (countable) of frequencies. This is the typical result of the blade periodic movement and interaction with its own wake, that generate a periodic variation in the pressure field.
The tonal noise is modeled as the sum of harmonics of the Blade Passing Frequency

\[BPF=N_{blades}\cdot f_{rot}\]

with intensity decreasing with the harmonic order. Higher harmonics arise due to non-linear aerodynamic effects and blade–wake interactions.

### 2.2. Broadband noise model

In contrast to a tonal noise, a broadband noise is a signal whose energy is spread more evenly across a broader range of frequencies, rather than being concentrated. Its nature is connected to the chaotic behavior of the flow in which the blades move, resulting in stochastic fluctuation in the pressure field and non periodic sound effects. The broadband noise component models the stochastic pressure fluctuations generated by airfoil-turbulence interaction.
It is numerically represented as a colored Gaussian stochastic process, obtained by filtering white noise in the frequency domain to reproduce the typical spectral decay observed at higher frequencies.
This approach provides a low-order but physically meaningful representation of turbulence-induced sound, suitable for signal processing and source localization studies.

### 2.3. Source directivity

Being the rotor a non-point object moving approximately along a plane, the diffusion of its noise is strongly non isotropic. Depending on the fidelity, several models can be adopted to model the directivity of the directional radiation. For the sake of simplicity, a dipole-like radiation pattern is used this case study, adopting a sine-power model of the sound intensity:

\[D(\theta)=\sin^p(\theta)\]

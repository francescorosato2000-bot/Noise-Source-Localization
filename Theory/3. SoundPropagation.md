# Sound propagation model

This file summarizes the numerical framework adopted to model the sound propagation. This means focusing on the propagation and diffusion of the sound, on the perception of the signal, so how fast the noise travels and decays, and on the interaction with the environment.

## 1. Signal travel modeling

To model the sound diffusion, the geometrical acoustics framework is adopted. This means that the signal is modeled through rays, so wave phenomena such as diffraction, refraction and scattering are neglected.
This low-order approximation is particularly meaningful when the wavelength is significantly smaller than the typical dimensions of the obstacles, which is a plausible hypothesis for the mid-to-high frequencies of UAV rotor noise.

## 2. Sound propagation in free space

The sound propagates in the environment with a finite velocity $c\simeq343\ \text{m/s}$. This means that each of the sensors will capture the signal with a delay, quantified as:

\[\tau=\frac{r}{c}\]

that will determine the distance $r$ between the sensor and the source.
Furthermore, when the signal travels in space, its energy is spread on a larger surface, meaning that the further an observer is, the weaker the signal is perceived. In the hypothesis of a spheric spreading, the pressure amplitude of the acoustic signal decays as:

\[A(r)\propto\frac{1}{r}\]

## 3. Interaction with the environment

To model reflections from obstacles, the image source method is adopted. Each reflection is represented by a virtual source obtained by mirroring the real source with respect to the reflecting surface. This approach allows reflected propagation paths to be treated as direct paths from image sources, simplifying the computation of delays and attenuations while preserving the essential multipath structure of the acoustic field.

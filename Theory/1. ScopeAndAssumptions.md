# Introduction

This case study investigates acoustic propagation in urban environments with the specific aim of generating physically consistent acoustic signals for the development and testing of sound source localization algorithms. The present file contains a description of the fundamental hypotheses of the model used to model the sound generation and propagation in space. It also summarizes the domain where the method used gives the most accurate predictions.

## 1. Model validity and limitations

### 1.1. Model assumptions

The model adopted in this case study relies on the following assumptions:
- **Stationary hover**: the source is considered fixed, neglecting Doppler effect.
- **Point source approximation**: the rotor is modeled as an equivalent point source, valid in the acoustic farfield.
- **Linear acoustics**: the sound waves do not mutually interact and their contributions are linearly superposed.
- **Uncoupled source and propagation**: the sound generation is decoupled from environmental effects.
- **Prescribed directivity**: the acoustic directivity is imposed with a simplified, time- and frequency-invariant analytical model, and not derived from the rotor geometry nor coupled with the propagation process.
- **Geometrical acoustics**: other interactions with obstacles than absorption and reflection, such as diffraction and scattering, are neglected.

### 1.2. Domain of validation

- **High frequencies**: the geometrical acoustics approximation is valid when the acoustic wavelength is significantly smaller than the characteristic dimensions of the obstacles. 
- **Low Mach number**: a further condition for geometrical acoustics is that flow velocities are assumed much lower than the speed of sound.
- **Forward modeling for localization**: the propagation model is not intended for high-fidelity acoustic field prediction, but explicitly represents propagation delays and multipath effects, which constitute the primary cues exploited by time-based localization methods such as TDOA and beamforming.

### 1.3. Model limitations

- **Neglect of wave and non-linear phenomena**: wave effects such as diffraction and scattering are not resolved, and non-linear phenomena associated with high sound pressure levels or high Mach number are neglected. This leads to inaccurate predictions at low frequencies.
- **Obstacle modeling**: the obstacles are modeled as ideal reflecting surfaces with constant parameters in both the time and frequency domain.
- **Simplified source representation**: the model assumes a point source, so the directivity is not solved based on rotor geometry, but rather assumed constant.
- **Atmospheric effects neglected**: temperature gradients, wind and turbulence effects are neglected.
